# bats_model_2026
A personal project developing a machine learning model (MLM) to predict the species of bat within a sample call. 

### Phases of Project:
1. Gather personal funding for spare time (Jan-March)
2. Gather raw data (March-April)
3. Begin splitting data by species and into training/test categories. Aim for small scale 100-200 sample calls for training. (April)
4. Model coding and testing (April-May)
